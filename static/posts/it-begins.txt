23 March 2015:

It's the day before I embark on my big trip. The emotional 
reality sunk in at last while packing my 65L rucksack, my sole piece of 
luggage. Of course I intellectually accented to the idea of my trip a 
while back, certainly after buying the plane tickets if not earlier. 
This has been a dream of mine at least since I graduated from college 
and went straight into a full time job with the company I had been 
interning with. I felt I had deprived myself of an opportunity to 
maximize the freedoms afforded by youth, and I envied the freewheeling 
nomads I met while a 9 to 5 working stiff. The dream started as a 
nebulous desire to travel and &ldquo;be free&rdquo; and gradually 
refined and clarified as I made concretes steps towards its eventual 
fulfillment.

I owe a debt of gratitude to the multitude of online resources that 
helped me conceive of and prepare for this journey but especially the 
blog of one Alex MacCaw, who's posts on his adventure in 2011 
served as inspiration and a template for my own:

I bought my flight tickets and Travelex travel insurance through 
Airtreks (<http://www.airtreks.com/>) for a 
measly $2000. Their expert travel advice on their sister site 
<http://www.bootsnall.com/> was enormously 
helpful in navigating all the uncertainties I faced regarding long-term 
travel and in deciding what gear to purchase.

The flights I have purchased *so far* will take me from my home state of 
Florida, USA to Istanbul Turkey via several major cities:

2. San Francisco = 1 week
3. Honolulu = 1 month
4. Tokyo = 1 month
5. Hong Kong = 1 month
6. Bangkok = 1 month
7. Istanbul = ???

As you can see, I haven't completed the circle yet. That's
 all part of the plan. Once in Istanbul I'll have access to the 
EU's train network and at some point in my journey I'll 
(probably) buy a plane ticket from Europe or North Africa to back to 
North America.

On some level this trip is about escaping from myself, or perhaps 
escaping my limitations. I look forward to day long hiking expeditions, 
making travel buddies, attending festivals and other high points, but I 
expect and even welcome the low points, the experiences that will 
stretch me and sharpen my understanding of myself and the workings of 
the world. I view it as an investment in myself. I'll have a 
stockpile of good memories to savor when I'm back in familiar 
territory and problem solving and coping mechanisms honed by experiences 
such as being locked out of my hostel at midnight in central Istanbul.

My next post will be about the city shrouded in legend and fog, San 
Francisco! But for now I still have a little packing to do.
