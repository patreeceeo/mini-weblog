24 March 2015:

The sun was setting as I stepped out of Oakland international airport and made my way to the BART. On the horizon a silhouette of rectangular obelisks and one oblong pyramid huddled together like a modern druid monument against a fiery sky, San Francisco patiently waiting to welcome me back.

"You’ve arrived” said the girl sitting next to me on the bus. Seeing my giant rucksack she had taken me for a drifter, though a clean, well-dressed drifter, and suggested that maybe I’ve finally come home. “There’s no reason to ever want to leave” her wild eyes didn’t quite meet mine. Little did she know it is only my launching off point, though I do see where she’s coming from. My one week here will be over in a flash.

The overriding feeling I have about being back is that of having undeserved privilege. I feel privileged to be here among giants who have managed to make this city their home and held on through its ups and downs. I believe all individuals have inherent value, but it its a special person that can hang tight in this crazy town. So I've learned to be thankful to be in such a wonderful place. I think there's a positive feedback loop created by people who are also aware of how lucky they to be in a certain community, and in response they generously contribute in their particular way to making the community even better.

I arrived safely at the apartment of my friend Shing, who’s graciously letting me stay on his couch. It’s hard to cool down the excitement I feel about being here, but I eventually drift off to sleep.
