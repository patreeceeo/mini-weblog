5:45 AM, 25 March 2015:

The alarm goes off, Shing and I get dressed in workout clothes and run to Alta Plaza. There we’ll be met by several dozen other people who prefer to trade late morning slumbers for free fitness and a lot of fun. This is [November Project](http://november-project.com/). This group (cult, movement, phenomenon) holds free workouts in the city’s parks a few mornings each week and could be described as a “hugging group with a running problem.”

They trickle in slowly at first. It’s still dark, making face recognition a little challenging. Greetings are exchanged with hugs and hushed voices. Mine are particularly enthusiastic since I’ve been absent a few months. Today is PR Wednesday, which means that in lieu of a regular workout we’ll be trying to “PR” (personal record) in a fixed challenge that is repeated every month. The fixed challenge consists of four laps around the park perimeter and in between each lap, a grueling climb up a 50ft staircase to the center (the park is on a hill) just to do 10 “burpees” (an explosive squat/pushup exercise) before running back down to start the next lap. It was the toughest workout I’ve done since the last time I was at November Project, and I haven’t exactly been a couch potato. 

Every workout is concluded with a “finisher tunnel” and a group photo. Today we did both at the same time (pictured below). Then comes arguably the best part: Breakfast. Those lucky to have a flexible schedule go to a nearby cafe, Jane on Fillmore, and enjoy some well-deserved carbs, protein, coffee etc. Of course I was one of those lucky people today.

Remember what I said yesterday about community, a feedback loop of generosity and thankfulness? November Project is a case in point. In addition to the free fitness, they’ve been like a family away from family and its all thanks to the guys (and gal) who are the official leaders as well as numerous other dedicated individuals who give their time, resources and talents to make NP an outstanding interest-based community.
